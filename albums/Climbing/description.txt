Escher used to take a break from his intense sessions is his studio by walking in the woods and this print is a result of one of those walks. As in Three Worlds, also a result of these walks, he has captured within the puddle the multiple elements of physical reality: earth, water, sky. Civilization's mark is apparent in the tire tracks and footpirnts left in the mud. The tree branches reflected in the puddle are very similar to the trees seen in an earlier work from MCE's Italian landscape period, Pineta Of Calvi, Corsica, a 1933 woodcut.
