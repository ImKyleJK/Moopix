In contrast to many other depictions of the biblical story, such as those by Pieter Brueghel the Elder (The Tower of Babel) and Gustave DorÃ© (The Confusion of Tongues), Escher depicts it as a geometrical structure and places the viewpoint above the tower. This allows him to exercise his skill with perspective, but he centred the picture around the top of the tower because that was the focus for the climax of the action. He later commented:

Some of the builders are white and others black. The work is at a standstill because they are no longer able to understand one another. Seeing as the climax of the drama takes place at the summit of the tower which is under construction, the building has been shown from above though from a birds eye view.
